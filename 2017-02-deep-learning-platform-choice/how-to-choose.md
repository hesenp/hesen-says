# How To Choose Between Of Many Deep Learning Platforms?

As of the writing of this essay, the tech community has been
innundated with deep learning platform claiming record smashing
performance. Each of the platform might be featured with buzz words
revolving around high-throughput distributed parallel
computing. Depending on which tech sub-community you are at, your news
stream might be blasted with essays touting TensorFlow (if you are Bay
Area bound), CNTK (if you live near Redmond, WA), or MXNet (if you
live in Downtown Seattle).

Most of the DL tool chain introductions focus on a specific platform
without horizontal comparison. I would like to provide a wide
horizontal review across most of the major DL platforms in this
article. I will provide a few check points to consider on how to
choose what deep learning platform to adopt. Hopefully you will get a
good idea about the judgement after reading this artilcle. I
summarized all these information partly thanks to my day job as an
experienced machne learning scientist. The factors considered should
cover folks from rookies to seasoned ML architects in the IT field.
